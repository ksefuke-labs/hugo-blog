## About Me

Greetings, I'm Kasonde A. Sefuke but you can call me Kas. I'm a desktop support engineer transitioning to Devops.
I created this blog to document the technologies, tools, and ideas that I’m learning along the way, as well as the things that genuinely interest me.

I've always been a tinkerer, messing with Lego as child, to CAD and CNC software in Secondary School and College.
I has some experience messing with the odd computer here and there throughout my childhood. However, it was only after building my first custom PC back in 2016 that i considered pursuing IT as a career.
Since then i've built several PC's, switched to Linux (for everything), and built a homelab where I host my own services and experiment with new technologies and services.

Outside of tech, I enjoy listening to music and playing the occasionally indie game.

### Beats to listen to
I'm placing a bandcamp card at the end of each article to give you insight into my music taste, which is all over the place. You have been warned.

**ALERT!** - Lower your volume, the embedded bandcamp player doesn't have volume controls and it's quite loud by default.
