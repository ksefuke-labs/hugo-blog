## About Me

Greetings, I'm Kasonde A. Sefuke but you can call me Kas. I'm a desktop support engineer transitioning to Devops.
I created this blog to document the technologies, tools, and ideas that I’m learning along the way, as well as the things that genuinely interest me.

I've always been a tinkerer, messing with Lego as child, to CAD and CNC software in Secondary School and College.
I has some experience messing with the odd computer here and there throughout my childhood. However, it was only after building my first custom PC that interest in IT began to blossom.
Since then i've built several PC's, switched to Linux for everything, and built a homelab where i host my own services and experiment with new technologies in a hands environment.

Outside of tech, i enjoy listening to music and playing the occasionally indie game.

I will be placing a bandcamp card (not a fan of spotify) at the end of each article, to give you insight into my music taste.
