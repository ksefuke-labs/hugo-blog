It started off as a means of storing and streaming of my purchased music and progressed into something else entirely.\nPrevious Next This post details my home lab adventures so far and whats to come in the future.\nWhat started the spiral # I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a fan of music streaming services like spotify as i prefer to own my music and have built up a quite a large collection over the years. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of storing personal files using cloud storage providers like google drive, Microsoft Onedrive and Apple Icloud. A Synology Nas was an option but i really wanted to build something myself.\nA spectacular video from German Youtuber \u0026ldquo;Wolfgang\u0026rsquo;s Channel\u0026rdquo; detailing the build process for a custom NAS sparked my interest, i but was turned off due to my lack understanding of Linux at the time (2021). It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until i deleted my windows install and fully migrated to Arch Linux back in 2022 that i decided to revisit the idea again.\nObjectives # Me being the over thinker that i am wanted to identify all of my current requirements and take future requirements into consideration:\nAll in one - Wanted to be able to host services in addition it being a NAS. Quiet and power efficient - Server would live in my room, on my desk so it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be loud. Small - Ideally ITX form factor so it\u0026rsquo;s not cumbersome to tinker with or store. No vendor lock in or subscriptions - The Primary reason for doing this Hardware Acceleration Support Flexible and Cheap to expand/scale Choice of Operating Systems # To satisfy the \u0026ldquo;all in one\u0026rdquo; requirement for my homelab i could have just installed ubuntu server edition and left it at that. But me being the chronic tinkerer that i am wanted to be able to break things without having reinstall the core os (Had already broken several arch based installs already at this point). I stumbled across Perfect Media Server by Alex Kretzschmar which suggested using proxmox as the core OS.\nProxmox VE is a type 1 hypervisor based on debian that\u0026rsquo;s free to deploy, has very few limits imposed on users without a Enterprise Subscription and has a fantastic web interface and shell. It can used to provision traditional virtual machines and linux containers (LXC). I do have experience supporting Vmware infrastructure in my MSP Cloud Analyst role but didn\u0026rsquo;t consider it an option due to the shear difference in free feature set (in 2023):\nProxmox VE:\nFull clustering capabilities High availability Live migration Backup and restore tools with advanced features (deduplication, compression, incremental backups) Both KVM (full virtualization) and LXC (containers) Web-based management interface ZFS, LVM, iSCSI, NFS storage support No core or memory limitations VMware ESXi:\nCould only run on a limited number of cores and had extremely limited memory No vCenter Server access - Centralised Panel/dashboard for managing multiple ESXI servers. No Distributed Resource Scheduler No fault tolerance Free Edition completely dropped into 2024 accompanied by significant licensing changes which burned a lot of companies wallets. Choice of NAS # Openmediavault was my goto NAS option at the time. Its based on Debian under the hood and provided all require services (Hdparm, NFS, Rsync, SSH, S.M.A.R.T, SMB ) out of the box or via plugins (ZFS Support).\nNote - I will admit the initial configuration of services and disks can be quite tedious due to the config confirmation nature of OMV, every change needs to be confirmed/applied and it\u0026rsquo;s in your best interest to not commit multiple changes at once. As a config error may force you revert them. (Speaking from experience)\nThere were other DIY solutions at the time, but these didn\u0026rsquo;t meet my requirements for a number of reasons:\nUbuntu Server- I wasn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable manually configuring all backed services at the time and wanted something that just worked so i start tinkering with services. There are gui apps such Red Hat\u0026rsquo;s Cockpit and webmin which can installed on ubuntu server, but i found those to be a bit finicky. Obviously now i am aware the CLI is the superior way due to things with scripting and automation. Unraid - requires a license to use after 30 days. It was also way too web gui oriented for my liking. Note - There is a fork of unraid open-source md_unraid kernel driver called non-raid TrueNAS\u0026rsquo; ZFS is a fantastic filesystem, but it requires all the drives to be spun up all the time (see this post🙃) which increases power usage by 20w-30w. In addition to require purchasing drives in sets to expand available storage depending on the raid setup. Filesystems # I deployed XFS on my high capacity NAS hard drives and ZFS on proxmox boot and vm SSDs, in addition to the NAS SSDs. Alongside mergerfs and snapraid to compine drive directories\nZFS # ZFS\u0026rsquo;s copy-on-write design reduces write amplification on SSDs. Its ARC/L2ARC caching, built-in LZ4 compression, and checksumming provide excellent performance and data integrity. TRIM support maintains long-term SSD health.\nOrigin: Created by Sun Microsystems (2005) for Solaris to solve enterprise data integrity and scalability issues. Now maintained as OpenZFS after Oracle\u0026rsquo;s acquisition.\nEnterprise use: Widely deployed by financial institutions, cloud providers (Netflix), and media companies for databases, VM storage, and mission-critical data requiring snapshots and self-healing.\nXFS # XFS\u0026rsquo;s allocation group architecture enables parallel access across large HDDs, minimising seek time bottlenecks. Extent-based allocation and delayed writes optimise layout for multi-terabyte files. B-tree directories and online growth make it ideal for massive filesystems.\nOrigin: Developed by SGI (1993) for IRIX to handle extreme demands of 3D graphics and super-computing. Open-sourced in 2001, became RHEL\u0026rsquo;s default filesystem in 2014.\nEnterprise use: Standard for scientific computing (CERN), video production studios, backup systems, and cloud object storage backends where large HDDs (10TB+) provide cost-effective cold storage\nMergerfs # Developed by Antonio SJ Musumeci (trapexit) under ISC license. Evolved from earlier union filesystems like unionfs and mhddfs to address home storage needs. Used by the Perfect Media Server community, self-hosters, small businesses, and content creators managing large media libraries with mixed drive sizes.\nLogically merges multiple drives into single mount point without striping data Each file lives entirely on one disk, so drives remain individually readable Drive failure only affects data on that specific drive Supports mixed drive sizes and different filesystems Flexible policies control data distribution across drives Simple configuration with one line in /etc/fstab (example below) /mnt/disk* /mnt/storage fuse.mergerfs defaults,nonempty,allow_other,use_ino,cache.files=off,moveonenospc=true,category.create=mfs,dropcacheonclose=true,minfreespace=250G,fsname=mergerfs 0 0 Snapraid # Developed by amadvance under GPLv3. Active since early 2010s with ongoing updates. Cross-platform support for Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD, Solaris. Targeted at media centers with large static files. Standard solution in self-hosted community, used by content creators and small production studios as alternative to unRAID and traditional RAID.\nCan be used alongside mergerfs to provide some redudancy. Stores parity for recovery from up to six disk failures Non-realtime: manual backup execution required (not live RAID) Works with existing data without reformatting Hashes all data for integrity verification Supports mixed drive sizes, add drives anytime Lower power consumption (only accessed disks spin up) NFS # NFS over samba for file shares was a no brainer as i am literally the only person in the house hold that has a PC (which is on linux). NFS also has native integration with docker volumes.\nPCIE Passthrough # Did i forget mention the NAS was virtualized? While researching Proxmox i discovered you can pass-through PCIE devices into VMs so they appear as native devices. The idea of leaving the NAS disk exposed on proxmox and provisioning block storage from them to be virtualized on OMV felt gross and i wanted near native performance from OMV\nBelow is the general process for systems using systemd-boot:\n# 1.

Future Improvements # Dedicated Hardware for Baremetal NAS Running a NAS as a virtual machine has proven to be quite stable and flexible. But i would love to move it to dedicated hardware at some point, there is something about the setup that makes me feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a snake eating it\u0026rsquo;s own tail. Especially isn\u0026rsquo;t helpful if i have to switch of the proxmox node for maintenance. Considering getting another 2u chassis and moving proxmox to that instead?\nKubernetes on spare mini pc\u0026rsquo;s I honestly haven\u0026rsquo;t touched the 2 minisforum n100d mini pcs i bought them back in June besides installing proxmox on them, i bought them with initial idea of clustering them and messing with zfs/ceph replication. But i decided against it as i didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough services to warrant spreading them out. Now with my migration to Kubernetes from docker underway. I plan to install K3S or Talos Linux on them directly and cluster them\nTunes to jam to! # Listen on Bandcamp ","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/state-of-the-homelab-2026/","section":"Articles","summary":"","title":"State of the Homelab 2026","type":"articles"},{"content":" ","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to Blowfish!","summary":"","title":"Welcome to Blowfish!","type":"page"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m no stranger to the linux terminal.
